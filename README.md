## üì° Current News Sources

We prioritize a mix of reliable RSS feeds for efficiency and targeted HTML scraping for sources without comprehensive feeds.

1.  **CoinDesk:** (RSS Feed) - A leading source for cryptocurrency news, price, and information.
2.  **CoinTelegraph:** (RSS Feed) - Offers news, analysis, and reviews on blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, and fintech.
3.  **Bitcoinist:** (HTML Scraped) - Provides news and analysis covering Bitcoin, altcoins, and blockchain. *(Note: This source requires direct HTML scraping due to limited RSS feed content).*
4.  **The Defiant:** (RSS Feed) - Focuses on decentralized finance (DeFi) news and trends.
5.  **CryptoPanic:** (RSS Feed) - An aggregator that collects news from various crypto sources.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Quick Start

Getting your daily Web3 newsletter up and running is quick and easy!

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Web3-Newsletter-Generator.git](https://github.com/your-username/Web3-Newsletter-Generator.git)
    cd Web3-Newsletter-Generator
    ```

2.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    All required libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and populate it with your Telegram Bot Token and Chat ID.
    * **`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`**: Obtain this by creating a new bot with `@BotFather` on Telegram.
    * **`TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`**: Get your chat ID by forwarding a message from your desired chat to `@getidsbot` or similar.

    ```dotenv
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
    TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID_HERE
    # Optional: If using a paid AI service, add your API key here
    # OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_api_key
    ```

4.  **Run the Scheduler:**
    This script will set up the daily job to fetch news, process it, and send the newsletter.
    ```bash
    python scheduler.py
    ```
    The newsletter will now be delivered to your specified Telegram chat daily.

## üîß Advanced Configuration

The `config.py` file provides extensive options for customizing your newsletter:

* **`TOP_ARTICLES_DAILY`**: Adjust the maximum number of articles to include in each daily newsletter.
* **Adding/Removing News Sources:**
    * You can easily modify the `NEWS_SOURCES` list to include new sources or remove existing ones.
    * **For RSS Feeds:**
        ```python
        {
            "name": "NewRSSSource",
            "url": "[https://newsource.com/rss_feed.xml](https://newsource.com/rss_feed.xml)",
            "type": "rss"
        }
        ```
    * **For HTML Scraped Sources:**
        * This requires defining specific CSS selectors to accurately extract content. Use browser developer tools to identify these.
        * `container`: CSS selector for the main article block.
        * `title`: CSS selector for the article's title.
        * `link`: CSS selector for the article's URL.
        * `summary`: CSS selector for the article's summary/excerpt (if available on the listing page).
        * `date`: CSS selector for the article's publication date.
        ```python
        {
            "name": "NewHTMLSource",
            "url": "[https://newsource.com/news](https://newsource.com/news)",
            "type": "html",
            "scrape_pattern": {
                "container": "article.news-item",
                "title": "h2.article-title a",
                "link": "h2.article-title a",
                "summary": "p.article-summary",
                "date": "span.article-date"
            }
        }
        ```
* **Similarity Thresholds (`DEDUPLICATION_THRESHOLD`)**: Fine-tune the sensitivity of the deduplication algorithm. A higher value means articles need to be more similar to be considered duplicates.
* **AI Model Selection:** If using a language model, configure the model name and any specific parameters.

## ü™≤ Troubleshooting Common Issues

Encountering issues? Here are some common problems and their solutions:

* **`403 Forbidden` Errors when Scraping HTML:**
    * **Cause:** The target website might be actively blocking automated scraping (e.g., detecting `User-Agent` headers or frequent requests).
    * **Solution:**
        * Try rotating `User-Agent` headers (though not explicitly implemented in this basic setup).
        * Introduce longer `time.sleep()` delays between requests to that specific source in the scraping logic.
        * Consider using a proxy service if the issue persists and the data is critical.
        * *Best Practice:* Always check the website's `robots.txt` file and Terms of Service before scraping.
* **Timeouts During Article Fetching:**
    * **Cause:** The server hosting the news source might be slow to respond, or your network connection might be unstable.
    * **Solution:** Increase the `timeout` parameter within the `newspaper_config` (if using `newspaper3k`) or any `requests` calls for HTML sources.
* **Partial Articles or Missing Content:**
    * **Cause:** The RSS feed might be truncated, or the HTML scraping selectors are incorrect/outdated, failing to capture the full article content.
    * **Solution:**
        * **For RSS:** Verify the RSS feed URL directly in your browser to ensure it's providing full content.
        * **For HTML:** Re-inspect the website's HTML structure using browser developer tools and update the `scrape_pattern` selectors in `config.py` accordingly. Websites frequently update their layouts, which can break scrapers.
* **Newsletter Not Sending:**
    * **Cause:** Incorrect `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` or `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` in your `.env` file, or a network issue preventing connection to Telegram API.
    * **Solution:** Double-check your environment variables. Test your Telegram Bot token directly with a simple API call if unsure.

## ‚ö° Optimization & Best Practices

To ensure efficient and ethical scraping, consider these tips:

* **Prioritize RSS Over HTML Scraping:** RSS feeds are designed for content syndication, are less resource-intensive, and less likely to be blocked. Use HTML scraping only when a robust RSS feed is unavailable.
* **Set Realistic Timeouts:** Don't let your script hang indefinitely. Use timeouts (e.g., 15-30 seconds) for network requests.
* **Implement Caching:** For AI summaries or frequently accessed data, implement a simple caching mechanism to reduce API calls and processing time.
* **Monitor Source Rate Limits:** Be mindful of how frequently you hit a particular news source. Overly aggressive scraping can lead to IP bans or temporary blocks. Introduce delays (`time.sleep()`) between requests to the same domain.
* **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement robust `try-except` blocks around network requests and processing steps. Log errors comprehensively to quickly diagnose issues.

## üìà Future Enhancements

This project can be further enhanced with more advanced features:

* **Persistence for Read Articles:** Store a list of articles already sent to prevent sending them again in future digests, even if they reappear on news feeds.
* **Sentiment Analysis:** Integrate natural language processing (NLP) to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of articles.
* **User Preferences & Filters:** Allow users to customize topics of interest, preferred sources, or even keywords to include/exclude.
* **Multiple Channel/User Support:** Extend the Telegram integration to send newsletters to multiple chats or individual users based on their preferences.
* **Database Integration:** Instead of just sending a daily newsletter, store all scraped articles in a local database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) for historical analysis and searchability.
* **Web Interface (Optional):** Develop a simple web UI to manage sources, view historical newsletters, and configure settings.
* **More Advanced AI Summarization:** Explore different LLM models or fine-tuning techniques for even more nuanced summaries.
